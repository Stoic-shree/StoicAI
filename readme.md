# Chat with PDF using OpenRouter 🤖📄

An intelligent PDF question-answering system that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to extract insights from your documents. Upload PDFs, ask questions in natural language, and get accurate answers based on document content.

## Overview

This application implements a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system that enables users to interact with PDF documents through natural language queries. Instead of manually searching through lengthy documents, users can ask questions and receive contextually relevant answers powered by OpenAI's GPT models.

### What is RAG?

Retrieval-Augmented Generation combines:
1. **Information Retrieval**: Finding relevant document sections using vector similarity search
2. **Language Generation**: Using an LLM to synthesize answers from retrieved context

This approach ensures responses are grounded in your specific documents rather than relying solely on the model's pre-trained knowledge.

---

## Features

- **Multi-PDF Support**: Upload and process multiple PDF files simultaneously
- **Natural Language Queries**: Ask questions in plain English
- **Semantic Search**: Uses vector embeddings for intelligent document search
- **Context-Aware Answers**: Responses are based solely on uploaded documents
- **Fast Processing**: FAISS vector database enables rapid similarity search
- **Secure**: API keys managed through environment variables
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Clean Streamlit UI for easy interaction
- **Persistent Storage**: Processed documents stored locally for quick re-querying
- **Real-Time Processing**: Immediate feedback during document processing

---

## Limitations

- **Internet Dependency**: Requires active internet connection for OpenRouter API access
- **PDF Format Constraints**: May not work optimally with scanned PDFs or image-based documents (no OCR support)
- **Token Limits**: Large documents may exceed model context window limits
- **Single Session**: No conversation history persistence across sessions
- **Index Replacement**: Uploading new PDFs replaces the existing index rather than appending
- **English Optimized**: Best performance with English language documents

### System Workflow

The diagram above illustrates the end-to-end flow of the application:

1.  **Input**: Users upload PDF documents via the Streamlit interface.
2.  **Processing**: The system extracts text, splits it into chunks, and generates vector embeddings using OpenAI models.
3.  **Storage**: These embeddings are stored in a local FAISS vector database for efficient retrieval.
4.  **Querying**: When a user asks a question, it is converted into a vector and compared against the stored embeddings to find relevant context.
5.  **Response**: The relevant context and the user's question are sent to the LLM (GPT-4o-mini), which generates an accurate, context-aware answer.
